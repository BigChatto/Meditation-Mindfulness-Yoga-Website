        <p> <strong>1</strong> Meditation is one of the healthiest and beneficial habits one can cultivate.
            Meditation is quite simple to learn. It is also one of the rare habits which you can do anytime,
            anywhere for any duration of time to reap instantaneous benefits.
            <strong>2</strong> Meditation can be learned without a teacher and at one’s own pace.
            Meditate for Just 2 Minutes Every Day: Most beginners commit the mistake of trying to meditate for 10
            minutes straight. One of the best things you can do to make this habit stick is to commit to just 2
            minutes
            every day. Once you are comfortable with the practice, you can gradually commit to a few more minutes.
            Meditate for 2 minutes every day in the first week and for 5 minutes in the second week. You will
            eventually
            clock in more minutes as this becomes a daily habit.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3</strong> Stick to a Time: Pick a time of the day to meditate daily and stick to it. Whether it is
            morning, noon or
            night, make
            sure you take two minutes of your time to sit peacefully and meditate. By doing this, meditation will
            become a daily
            trigger just like brushing your teeth, having breakfast, etc. and soon you will find yourself not
            missing your daily
            mindfulness session.</p>

        <p><strong>4</strong> Find a Comfortable Posture: Meditation does not require you to sit cross-legged or in any
            particular
            asana for the
            practice to be effective. While some people prefer sitting on the floor on a yoga mat to meditate,
            others find it more
            comfortable to sit on a chair or a couch. What matters is that you are comfortable in the posture you
            choose. Meditating
            daily will be no fun if you are uncomfortable in your meditation posture.</p>

        <p><strong>5</strong> Find a Quiet Place: Perhaps the most important thing to do while forming meditation as a
            daily habit is
            to make sure you
            find a quiet, comfortable place to meditate. Some people prefer meditating at home in the early morning
            hours before
            anybody in the house wakes up while some people prefer meditating in parks with the soothing sound of
            the nature to
            accompany them. Does not matter where you meditate as long as you are able to find a peaceful place
            where you will be
            undisturbed for a few minutes.</p>

        <p>
            Focus on Your Breath: Start the practice by closing your eyes and taking long, deep breaths. Follow the
            breath as you
            slowly breathe in (4 seconds), hold the breath (4 seconds), and breathe out (6 seconds). If it helps,
            count the breath.
            Count to 10 and when you get there, start over. Every time your mind wanders (which it eventually will),
            gently bring the focus back to the breath. In the beginning, your mind will tend to wander a lot. Don’t
            be upset when this happens. It is only natural. Our minds are not used to be still or in the present
            moment for long. As you continue to practice meditation daily, you will notice yourself getting better
            at it.
        </p>

        <p>Follow these above steps for a month and you’d have formed meditation as a daily habit.</p>

                body
                awareness. Resources for learning body scan and progressive muscle relaxation techniques include guided

                non-judgmental attitude. These practices reduce stress, enhance emotional regulation, and improve
                overall
                mental
                well-being. Resources for learning mindfulness and meditation include mindfulness apps, meditation
                retreats,

                meditation recordings, and books written by meditation experts.</p>

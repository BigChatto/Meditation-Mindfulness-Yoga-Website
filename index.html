        <h3>Tips on Meditation</h3>
        <div class="meditation-tips">
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Meditation is one of the healthiest and beneficial habits one can cultivate.
                        Meditation is quite simple to learn. It is also one of the rare habits which you can do anytime,
                        anywhere for any duration of time to reap instantaneous benefits.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Meditation can be learned without a teacher and at one’s own pace.
                        Meditate for Just 2 Minutes Every Day: Most beginners commit the mistake of trying to meditate
                        for
                        10
                        minutes straight. One of the best things you can do to make this habit stick is to commit to
                        just 2
                        minutes
                        every day. Once you are comfortable with the practice, you can gradually commit to a few more
                        minutes.
                        Meditate for 2 minutes every day in the first week and for 5 minutes in the second week. You
                        will
                        eventually
                        clock in more minutes as this becomes a daily habit.
                    </li>

                    <li> Find a Quiet Place: Perhaps the most important thing to do while forming
                        meditation as a
                        daily habit is
                        to make sure you
                        find a quiet, comfortable place to meditate. Some people prefer meditating at home in the early
                        morning
                        hours before
                        anybody in the house wakes up while some people prefer meditating in parks with the soothing
                        sound
                        of
                        the nature to
                        accompany them. Does not matter where you meditate as long as you are able to find a peaceful
                        place
                        where you will be
                        undisturbed for a few minutes. </li>


                    <li>Stick to a Time: Pick a time of the day to meditate daily and stick to it. Whether
                        it is
                        morning, noon or
                        night, make
                        sure you take two minutes of your time to sit peacefully and meditate. By doing this, meditation
                        will
                        become a daily
                        trigger just like brushing your teeth, having breakfast, etc. and soon you will find yourself
                        not
                        missing your daily
                        mindfulness session.
                    </li>

                    <li> Find a Comfortable Posture: Meditation does not require you to sit cross-legged or
                        in any
                        particular
                        asana for the
                        practice to be effective. While some people prefer sitting on the floor on a yoga mat to
                        meditate,
                        others find it more
                        comfortable to sit on a chair or a couch. What matters is that you are comfortable in the
                        posture
                        you
                        choose. Meditating
                        daily will be no fun if you are uncomfortable in your meditation posture.</li>


                    <li>
                        Focus on Your Breath: Start the practice by closing your eyes and taking long, deep breaths.
                        Follow
                        the
                        breath as you
                        slowly breathe in (4 seconds), hold the breath (4 seconds), and breathe out (6 seconds). If it
                        helps,
                        count the breath.
                        Count to 10 and when you get there, start over. Every time your mind wanders (which it
                        eventually
                        will),
                        gently bring the focus back to the breath. In the beginning, your mind will tend to wander a
                        lot.
                        Don’t
                        be upset when this happens. It is only natural. Our minds are not used to be still or in the
                        present
                        moment for long. As you continue to practice meditation daily, you will notice yourself getting
                        better
                        at it.
                    </li>

                    <p>Follow these above steps for a month and you’d have formed meditation as a daily habit.</p>

                    awareness. Resources for learning yoga include attending classes at yoga studios, online tutorials,

                    develop a
